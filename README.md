## <span style="color: #b9d9eb">üöÄ About Me</span>

As an MCA and BCA graduate, my journey into the world of IT was both unexpected and transformative. Initially, I didn‚Äôt anticipate pursuing a career in technology, but taking Commerce with Computer Science in Pre-University shifted my trajectory in the right direction. My passion for creativity originally led me toward graphic design, but as I gained experience, I embraced the broader scope of development.

Throughout my internships, I evolved from a frontend developer to a backend developer, and ultimately a fullstack developer, balancing both the technical and creative aspects of development. I now look forward to building and designing projects that are not only user-friendly and functional but also maintain a level of professionalism and simplicity that makes them stand out.

I am eager to combine my technical skills and creative background to deliver engaging, intuitive, and effective solutions for users.
